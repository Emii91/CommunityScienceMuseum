        <h1>Biology & medicine</h1>
        <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the great
            wonders of the tiny world. </p>
        <p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of
            our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some
            major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.</p>
        <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild.
            Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>
